# Setup Complete - Test User Credentials Reset ✅

## Summary

I've added automatic test user password reset to the setup process!

## What Changed

### 1. **New File: `backend/scripts/reset-password.js`**
   - Resets super admin password: `admin@exits-lms.com` / `admin123`
   - Resets demo user password: `demo@exits-lms.com` / `demo123`
   - Runs automatically at the end of setup
   - Displays credentials clearly in console

### 2. **Updated: `setup.ps1`**
   - Added call to reset-password script at the end
   - Displays test user credentials
   - Handles errors gracefully if script fails

## How It Works

**When you run `.\setup.ps1`:**

1. ✅ Backend dependencies installed
2. ✅ Database tables created
3. ✅ Users seeded with initial passwords
4. ✅ **TEST USER PASSWORDS RESET** (NEW!)
5. ✅ Credentials displayed at end
6. ✅ Frontend bundled and ready

## Test Credentials After Setup

```
Super Admin:  admin@exits-lms.com / admin123
Demo Tenant:  demo@exits-lms.com  / demo123
```

## Login Instructions

1. **Start frontend:**
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4200/login
   ```

3. **Enter credentials:**
   ```
   Email:    admin@exits-lms.com
   Password: admin123
   ```

4. **Click Login** ✓

## Reset Password Anytime

If you need to reset passwords later:

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/reset-password.js
```

## What's Displayed at Setup End

After running setup, you'll see:

```

## Error Handling

If the reset script fails:
- ✅ Setup still succeeds
- ✅ Fallback credentials shown from seeding
- ✅ You can manually run the reset script later
- ✅ Same credentials will still work
