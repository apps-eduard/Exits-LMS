# Protected Roles Update - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Change Overview
Updated the system to only protect **Super Admin** role with automatic menu assignments and permissions. **Support Staff**, **Developer**, and **IT Support** roles are no longer auto-protected and require manual menu assignment.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Frontend - Protected Roles List ✅

#### File: `permission-matrix.component.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
private readonly protectedRoles = ["Super Admin", "Support Staff", "Developer"];
```

**After:**
```typescript
private readonly protectedRoles = ["Super Admin"];
```

**Impact:**
- Support Staff and Developer roles can now be manually configured
- Checkboxes in Permission Matrix are now enabled for these roles
- Menu assignments can be saved for these roles

#### File: `system-roles.component.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
private readonly protectedRoles = ['Super Admin', 'Support Staff', 'Developer'];
```

**After:**
```typescript
private readonly protectedRoles = ['Super Admin'];
```

**Impact:**
- These roles can now be edited (name/description changes allowed)
- Still protected from deletion (intentional - system roles should not be deleted)

---

### 2. Backend - RBAC Middleware ✅

#### File: `rbac.middleware.js`
**Before:**
```javascript
const PROTECTED_ROLES = ['Super Admin', 'Support Staff', 'Developer'];
```

**After:**
```javascript
const PROTECTED_ROLES = ['Super Admin'];
```

**Impact:**
- Only Super Admin automatically gets all permissions granted
- Support Staff and Developer must have permissions explicitly assigned
- IT Support was never in this list, so no change needed

---

### 3. Menu Assignments Cleared ✅

#### Roles Affected:
1. **Support Staff** - Cleared 30 auto-assigned menus
2. **Developer** - Cleared 30 auto-assigned menus  
3. **IT Support** - Cleared 4 menus (was manually assigned earlier)

#### Script Used:
`remove-auto-assigned-menus.js`

**Result:**
All three roles now have **0 menus assigned** and are ready for manual configuration.

---

## Why This Change?

### Before (Auto-Protected):
- ❌ Support Staff and Developer automatically got ALL 30 menus
- ❌ Could not customize which menus they see
- ❌ No flexibility in role configuration
- ❌ Checkboxes were disabled in Permission Matrix
- ❌ "Protected role" message when trying to edit

### After (Manual Assignment):
- ✅ Full control over which menus each role can access
- ✅ Can assign only relevant menus (e.g., IT Support → only Dashboard + System Logs)
- ✅ Checkboxes enabled in Permission Matrix
- ✅ Can edit role details if needed
- ✅ Better security through principle of least privilege

---

## How to Assign Menus Now

### Step 1: Login as Super Admin
Only Super Admin can assign menus to roles.

### Step 2: Navigate to Settings
`Super Admin → Settings → Permission Matrix tab`

### Step 3: Assign Menus
1. Find the role (Support Staff, Developer, or IT Support) in the matrix
2. Check the checkboxes for menus you want to assign
3. The checkboxes will now be **enabled** (not grayed out)
4. Click **"Save All Changes"** button at the top right

### Step 4: Verify
- Logout and login as a user with that role
- Check if assigned menus appear in the sidebar

## Database State

### Before:
| Role | Menus Assigned | Auto-Protected |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Super Admin | 30 | ✅ Yes |
| Support Staff | 30 | ✅ Yes |
| Developer | 30 | ✅ Yes |
| IT Support | 4 | ❌ No |
| tenant-admin | 1 | ❌ No |

### After:
| Role | Menus Assigned | Auto-Protected |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Super Admin | 30 | ✅ Yes (only this one) |
| Support Staff | 0 | ❌ No (ready for manual) |
| Developer | 0 | ❌ No (ready for manual) |
| IT Support | 0 | ❌ No (ready for manual) |
| tenant-admin | 1 | ❌ No |

## Rollback Plan

If you need to revert this change:

### 1. Restore Frontend Protected Roles:
```typescript
// In permission-matrix.component.ts and system-roles.component.ts
private readonly protectedRoles = ["Super Admin", "Support Staff", "Developer"];
```

### 2. Restore Backend Protected Roles:
```javascript
// In rbac.middleware.js
const PROTECTED_ROLES = ['Super Admin', 'Support Staff', 'Developer'];
```

### 3. Restore Auto-Assignment Logic:
The `loadRoleMenuAssignments()` function in `permission-matrix.component.ts` already has the logic:
```typescript
// For protected roles, assign all menus
roles.forEach((role: Role) => {
  if (this.isProtectedRole(role.name)) {
    const allMenuIds = this.allMenus().map(m => m.id);
    matrix[role.id] = new Set(allMenuIds);
  }
});
```
This will automatically assign all menus when you reload the Permission Matrix page.

## Security Notes

1. **Super Admin Protection Maintained** ✅
   - Still has all permissions and menus automatically
   - Cannot be deleted or modified

2. **System Roles Protected from Deletion** ✅
   - Support Staff, Developer, IT Support still cannot be deleted
   - Prevents accidental removal of critical roles

3. **Manual Assignment Required** ✅
   - Forces explicit permission grants
   - Better audit trail
   - Principle of least privilege

4. **Unique Email Constraint** ✅
   - Already implemented in previous step
   - Prevents duplicate accounts
