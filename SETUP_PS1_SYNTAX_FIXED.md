# Setup.ps1 Syntax Error Fixed ✅

## Issue

**Error:**
```
At K:\speed-space\Exits-LMS\setup.ps1:637 char:68
+ ... sues: https://github.com/apps-eduard/Exits-LMS" 
-ForegroundColor Cyan
+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The string is missing the terminator: ".
```

## Root Cause

The file contained **Unicode smart quotes** (curly quotes) instead of ASCII straight quotes. These were likely introduced when the file was edited in a word processor or certain editors that auto-convert quotes.

**Problematic characters:**
- `"` (Unicode U+201C - left double quotation mark)
- `"` (Unicode U+201D - right double quotation mark)  
- `'` (Unicode U+2018 - left single quotation mark)
- `'` (Unicode U+2019 - right single quotation mark)

PowerShell requires ASCII straight quotes for string literals.

## Solution

Replaced the smart quotes at line 637 with regular ASCII quotes:

**Before (Line 637):**
```powershell
Write-Host "Report issues: https://github.com/apps-eduard/Exits-LMS" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```
(with Unicode smart quotes around "Exits-LMS")

**After (Line 637):**
```powershell
Write-Host "Report issues: https://github.com/apps-eduard/Exits-LMS" -ForegroundColor Cyan
```
(with ASCII straight quotes)

## Verification

✅ **Script now runs successfully:**

```
PS K:\speed-space\Exits-LMS> .\setup.ps1
