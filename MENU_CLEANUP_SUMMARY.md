# Menu Cleanup Summary

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Duplicate Menus**
The following menus were removed from the sidebar as they are already accessible within System Settings:

- ❌ **System Roles** - Available at `/super-admin/settings` (Roles tab)
- ❌ **Menu Management** - Available at `/super-admin/settings` (Menus tab)
- ❌ **Email Templates** - Available at `/super-admin/settings` (Email tab)

### 2. **Renamed Menus**
Menus were renamed for better clarity:

| Old Name | New Name | Route |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Health Check | **Health and Logs** | `/super-admin/health` |
| All Tenants | **Tenants** | `/super-admin/tenants` |
| All Subscriptions | **Subscriptions** | `/super-admin/subscriptions` |
| System Notifications | **Notifications** | `/super-admin/notifications` |
| Security Settings | **System Settings** | `/super-admin/settings` |

### 3. **Combined Logs Under Health and Logs**
Audit Logs and System Logs are now organized under the "Health and Logs" parent menu:

```
Health and Logs
├── Audit Logs
├── System Logs
├── Performance Metrics
├── Error Logs
└── Background Jobs
```

## Files Updated

### 1. Database Changes
- **File:** `backend/cleanup-navbar-menus.js` ✅ Executed
- **Changes:**
  - Deleted duplicate menus
  - Renamed 5 menus
  - Reorganized Audit/System Logs under Health and Logs

### 2. Seed File Updates

  - Removed duplicate menu entries
  - Applied all renames
  - Updated parent-child relationships
  - Fixed order numbers
  - Updated summary counts in console output

## Running setup.ps1

✅ **Safe to run!** The `setup.ps1` script will now preserve all menu cleanup changes because:

1. The seed file (`seed-menus.js`) has been updated with the new structure
2. Running `npm run seed:menus` will apply the cleaned-up menu structure
3. All changes are permanent and version-controlled

## Verification Steps

After running setup or reseeding:

1. Login as Super Admin
2. Check sidebar for cleaned-up menu structure
3. Verify "Health and Logs" contains both Audit and System Logs
4. Confirm Settings menu shows System Settings (not Security Settings)
5. Verify removed duplicates (System Roles, Menu Management, Email Templates) are gone from sidebar

## Database Script Location

The cleanup script is saved at:
```
backend/cleanup-navbar-menus.js
```

This can be run anytime to reapply changes if needed:
```bash
cd backend
node cleanup-navbar-menus.js
```
